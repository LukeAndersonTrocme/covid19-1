# Quebec Covid19 data

I parsed the `JSON` behind [the INSPQ
highcharts](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees) using `R` and
reproduced the graphs with `ggplot2`.

  - The cleaned data used to generate these graphs can be found in the
    [`data`](https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/covid19/tree/master/data)
    folder.  
  - The code used to scrape the data, clean it and plot it can be found
    at <http://sahirbhatnagar.com/covid19/>.  
  - The `R` script can be found in the
    [`bin`](https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/covid19/tree/master/bin)
    folder
